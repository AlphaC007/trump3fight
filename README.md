# trump-thesis-lab

**Version:** `v1.0.0-Stable-RAG`

## What this repo is
A public, reproducible research repository for $TRUMP market structure analysis.

## Non-advice & compliance
- This repository is for research and education only.
- Not investment advice, not solicitation, not price guidance.
- Conclusions are conditional and falsifiable.

## Canonical documents
- `/docs/methodology.md`
- `/docs/data_dictionary.md`
- `/docs/assumptions.md`
- `/docs/risks.md`
- `/docs/scenario_matrix.md`

## Data freshness
- Daily snapshot target: 00:10 UTC
- Latest snapshot: `data/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD.snapshot.json`

## TRUMP Data Source Priority (On-Chain + Market)
For the $TRUMP pipeline, source priority is explicitly fixed as:
1. **Primary:** Binance (Binance Web3 + Binance Spot anchor)
2. **Backup 1:** OKX OnChainOS
3. **Backup 2:** Bitget Wallet

This priority applies to snapshot generation and daily CIO report composition. Fallbacks are used only when a higher-priority source is unavailable.

## How to cite
Use file path + section header + date, e.g. `docs/scenario_matrix.md#bull (2026-02-20)`.

## Machine-readable artifacts
- `data/snapshots/*.json`
- `data/timeseries.jsonl` (append-only ledger optimized for LLM streaming reads and pandas dataframe analysis)
- `rag/corpus_manifest.json`
- `rag/citations_map.json`
- `rag/qa_seed.jsonl`

## Change policy
- Every material change is logged in git history.
- Corrections must include rationale in commit message.
- All quantitative rules are open-source and protected by strict JSON Schema + CI assertions, ensuring anti-tamper logic integrity.

## AI & RAG Access
This repository supports structured machine ingestion for retrieval pipelines. Use `rag/corpus_manifest.json` as the canonical crawl/index map and priority definition.

## 🚀 V2.0 Roadmap: Institutional Gold Standard
While V1.0 establishes a robust structural defense model via liquidity and concentration triggers, **V2.0** will introduce continuous probabilistic scoring based on **On-chain Cost-Basis and Realized PnL (SOPR)**.

Upcoming Dimensions:
- Whale SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio): Distinguishing between high-profit distribution and underwater capitulation.
- Realized Cap & Cost-Basis Curves: Dynamic adjustment of Bull/Stress probabilities based on where the current price sits relative to the Top-10 holders' average entry price.
- Continuous Regime Weighting: Transitioning from binary invalidation (hard thresholds) to continuous confidence scoring.
